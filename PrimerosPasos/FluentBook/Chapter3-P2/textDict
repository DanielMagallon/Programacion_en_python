Introduction: Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file.

Bash can run most sh scripts without modification. bash-completion is a collection of
shell functions that take advantage of the programmable completion feature of bash
on Ubuntu Linux.
